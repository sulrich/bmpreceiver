BMP Receiver

This is a Python implementation of the BMP protocol, as a receiver.

So far, it handles BMP versions 1 and 3. The objective is to provide
a working example of how to parse BMP protocol messages. Performance
and exhaustive logging are not goals.

There is a lot about BGP that it doesn't understand, MP_REACH_NLRI is
a particularly good example. Patches are welcome.

The version 1 code was written against test files generated from an
implementation of draft-ietf-grow-bmp-02 on a Juniper router. 

The version 3 code was written against a test file generated from an
implementation of draft-ietf-grow-bmp-07 on a Cisco router. 

If you run this code and get assertion failures, please generate a
test file that reproduces the assertion and send it to the author.

Code:

bmp-receiver.py	- the receiver code
BGP.py		- constants and support functions for the BGP protocol
BMP.py		- constants and support functions for the BMP protocol
indent.py	- utility function for calculating indentation

Test files: You can make test files suitable for feeding to
bmp-receiver.py's "-f" switch to test that the receiver is working.
The "nc" utility can be used to do this (assuming that 20000 is the
port number configured on the router):

    nc -l 20000 > testcase.bin
